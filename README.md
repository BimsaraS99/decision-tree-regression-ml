# Understanding Decision Tree Regression in Machine Learning

Decision Tree Regression is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. Unlike its counterpart, Decision Tree Classification, which is designed for discrete outcomes, Decision Tree Regression is tailored to handle regression problems. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of Decision Tree Regression, its structure, and how to implement it using Python's scikit-learn library.
